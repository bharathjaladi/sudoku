Using the Java Swing Library, I created my own rendition of the popular game Sudoku. Features of the game include the ability to load blank puzzles from a text file and save user progress so that the user can return to their game at any point in the future, even if the application was closed and reopened. The game also notifies the user if a number is placed in a square that is incorrect given the current state of the board and upon successful completion of the board, and has a hint algorithm that highlights all the potential squares in which a chosen number could appear. Try it out! The game can be played by running Game.java.
